# Development notes

## No spaces, please

Due to what looks like a GitBook [bug](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/issues/1070), internal links cannot have spaces within them - either in the path or the filename. If they do, they will generate a warning and broken output files.

Avoid spaces in paths and filenames, unless the bug is fixed.
